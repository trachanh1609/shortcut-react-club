 * JSX is javascript XML. It lets you write HTML-like markup in Javascript.
 * Let's give it a test.
 * 
 * Export a variable named "helloWorld" and assign it a JSX element.
 * The JSX element must have the text "Hello World!" wrapped in an h1 element.
 * 
 * NB: we are not creating components but assiging HTML-like markup into a Javascript variable.

 * Now let's make a more complex element.

 * The outer element should be a div with an attribute `className` of "card".
 * Inside the div, insert a h4 with content "John Doe" and a p element with content "Age: 42" 
 * 
 * NB: convention for complex JSX.
 * 1. To improve readability, wrap your element in parentheses ()
 * 2. One JSX element per line
 * 3. Use indentation
 * 
 * Example:
 * //bad
 * const element = <div><input/><button>Click me</button></div>
 * 
 * //OK
 * const element = (
 * 		<div>
 * 			<input />
 * 			<button>Click me</button>

  * React components are just this: functions that returns JSX (HTML-like) templates!
