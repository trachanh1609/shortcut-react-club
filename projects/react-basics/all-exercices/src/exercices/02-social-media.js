/**
 * 02-1 - Mini Project Into Components
 *
 * In this series of exercices, we will build a small Social Media posting platform.
 * We will reuse what we learned from the previous exercice and add some small new things.
 *
 * First, export a function named "Author". This functional Component accepts a props object as parameter.
 *
 * This functional component will expect to receive the following properties:
 * - [String] name: the name of the author
 * - [String] picture: The URL of the author's profile picture
 * - [String] bio: a short biography
 *
 * Your function should return a JSX div with className "so-me author"
 * Inside this div you will have 4 children:
 * - img with className "so-me user-img", img as picture prop and alt as author's name
 * - h4 with the author's name as content
 * - p with className "so-me bio" and the bio as content
 * - a with className "so-me profile-link", href "#/profile" and "View Profile" as content
 *
*/

export function Author(props) {
	const {name, picture, bio} = props ;
	return (
		<div className="so-me author">
			<img className="so-me user-img" src={picture} alt={name}/>
			<h4>{name}</h4>
			<p className="so-me bio">{bio}</p>
			<a className="so-me profile-link" href="#/profile">View Profile</a>

		</div>
	)
}

/**
 * 02-2 - Using the Author component
 *
 * 
 * Now that we have our first component we are going to create a React Element from it.
 * 
 * But first, some notes about the previous exercice:
 * 
 * If you know about constructor function and JS conventions, you should have seen some similarities with the Author function.
 * In js, with a constructor function, you would have used the "new" keyword to create a new instance.
 * In React, when we want to use a functional component, we use JSX and we do it Like so: <Author />
 * Because your components expect props, you'll need to pass them: <Author name="John Doe" bio="Lorem Ipsum" picture="htpps://..." />
 * 
 * Now that you know everything, export a variable named "stephenKingCard" and assign it an instance of an Author using the JSX syntax.
 * You will use the data from "stephenKing" object as prop values (use interpolation).
 * 
 * Conventions:
 *  If you want to improve readibility, sometimes you want to display one prop per line (expecially when there is more than 3 props)
 * To do so, here is the template:
 * 
 * const element = (
 * 	<MyComponent
 *     propA={someLongVariableThatNeedsALotOfSpace}
 *     propB={valueB}
 *     propC={() => {return "some inline function"}}
 *     propD={....}
 *  /> 
 * )
 *

export const stephenKing = {
	name: "Stephen King",
	picture: "http://www.famousbirthdays.com/headshots/stephen-king-1.jpg",
	bio: "Stephen Edwin King is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction,..."
}

export const stephenKingCard = (
	<Author 
		name={stephenKing.name}
		picture={stephenKing.picture}
		bio={stephenKing.bio}
	/>)
/**
 * 02-3 - a Post component
 *
 * export a function named "Post". Post is a functional Component, so it's expecting a "props" argument.
 *
 * You will expect the following props:
 * - [Object] author: an object with the keys: "name", "bio" and "picture"
 * - [String] title: the title of the Post
 * - [String] postedOn: the date of the post
 * - [Boolean] liked: if the post has been liked or not
 * - [React.Children] children: the inner elements passed to the component.
 *
 * Your function will return a div with className "so-me post".
 * The div will contain the following children:
 *  - Author: your Author component from exercice 1 with the props from the props.author object
 *  - div with className "so-me content" and following children:
 *    - h3 with className "so-me title" and the following children:
 *      - the title of the post
 *      - a (<a>) with href "#/like", className "so-me thumb" and a i (<i>) as children with className:
 *        - "fas fa-thumbs-up" if the props.liked is true
 *        - "far fa-thumbs-up" if the props.liked is false
 *    - div with className "so-me text" and as content your props.children
 *    - p with className "so-me metadata" and content "Posted on " + your postedOn prop
 *
 * 
 * Help with the <i> element:
 *  With {} you can interpolate most Javascript expressions.
 *  You can't evaluate an if else statement but you can evaluate a ternary operator
 *  "like ? <truthy statement> : <falsy statement>". I'll let you google "Javascript Ternary Operator"
 * 
 * Help with the props.children:
 *  Props are the parameters you pass to your component. When doing something like <MyButton>Click Me</MyButton>,
 *  the text "Click Me" is the inner element of MyButton, which makes it a parameter of MyButton, therefore a props of MyButton.
 *  In React, any inner attribute will be stored into your props as "children". It's up to you to pass it down or skip it.
 *  Check the react documentation about children for more details.

 *  - title: "Trump's Conference"
 *  - postedOn: "26/09/18"
 *  - author: the stephenKing object from exercice 2
 * 
 * Your component will have as children (the inner content):
